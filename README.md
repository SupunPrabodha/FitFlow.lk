## Project Structure
- `admin/`: Admin dashboard frontend (React, Tailwind CSS).
- `frontend/`: User-facing frontend (React, Tailwind CSS).
- `backend/`: Server-side logic and API (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB).

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (local or Atlas)
- **Visual Studio Code**
- **Git**

## Setup and Running the Project

Follow these steps to run FitFlow.lk locally in Visual Studio Code:

### 1. Clone the Repository:
  ```bash
    git clone [Insert GitHub Repository URL]
    cd FitFlow.lk
  ```

### 2. Install Dependencies:

- Navigate to each folder (`admin`, `frontend`, `backend`) and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd admin && npm install  
    cd ../frontend && npm install
    cd ../backend && npm install
    ```


### 3. Configure Environment Variables:

- In the `backend/` folder, create a `.env` file and add:
    ```bash
    MONGO_URI=[Your MongoDB Connection String]
    JWT_SECRET=[Your JWT Secret Key]
    ```


### 4. Run the Application:

- Open three terminal instances in VS Code (use Terminal > New Terminal or split terminals).
- Run the following commands in their respective folders:
  - Admin Dashboard:
      ```bash
      cd admin
      npm run dev
      ```  
      - Opens at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite).

  - Frontend (User Interface):
      ```bash
      cd frontend
      npm run dev
      ```
      - Opens at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite).

  - Backend Server:
      ```bash
      cd backend
      npm start
      ```

      - Runs at `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in your backend code).

## Access the Application:

- **Admin Dashboard**: Open http://localhost:5173 (adjust port if different).
- **User Interface**: Open http://localhost:5173 (adjust port if different).
 -**API Endpoints**: Test via Postman at http://localhost:5000.

## Notes
- Ensure MongoDB is running locally or use a MongoDB Atlas connection string.
- If ports conflict, check the terminal output for the correct port numbers.
- Use Postman to test API endpoints during development.
